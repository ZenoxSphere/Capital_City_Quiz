# Capital_City_Quiz
This is a quick program that I wrote to start learning how to use IntelliJ and Git/Github version control.

I have never used a professional IDE such as IntelliJ before, all of my current work has been done in BlueJ.

This program is very simple, it has a list of 10 countries and the user is given a random selection of them, the user then has to guess what the capital city of that country is and a score is given to the user on completion of the quiz.
